# GreyGone v1.0

**GreyGone** is a lightweight, transactional World of Warcraft addon designed to keep your bags clean. It automatically identifies and deletes grey (junk) items with zero effort.

## 🚀 Features

*   **Auto Remove:** Automatically scans and deletes grey items when you open your bags.
*   **Smart Looting:** Detects when you loot new grey items (or add to existing stacks) and deletes the new additions (or their related stacks) instantly (this option won't affect current bag loots that are not affected by new loot).
*   **Manual Nuke Button:** A large "DELETE GREYS NOW" button in the settings for immediate cleaning.
*   **Keybinding:** Bind a custom key (e.g., F5) to trigger a cleaning cycle without opening menus.
*   **Safety First:** Does not delete items while you are in combat.

## 📥 Installation

1.  Download the **GreyGone.zip** file.
2.  Extract the `GreyGone` folder.
3.  Move the folder to your WoW Addons directory:
    *   `World of Warcraft\_classic_era_\Interface\AddOns\`
4.  Restart WoW.

## ⚙️ Usage

*   **Open Settings:** Type `/greygone` in the chat or go to `Interface Options -> Addons -> GreyGone`.
*   **Set a Keybind:** In the settings menu, click "Set Keybind" and press your desired key.
*   **Manual Delete:** Open settings and click the big **DELETE GREYS NOW** button.

## ❓ FAQ

A: No. Quest items are not classified as "Grey" (Poor quality) by the game.

**Q: Does it work in Combat?**
A: No. For safety reasons, the addon pauses while you are in combat.
